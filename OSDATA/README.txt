This is my first trojan malware.
It asks for admin elevation
Creates a folder called "OSDATA" in C:\Windows\system32\config
Creates a registry key that boots the virus on startup (In case the victim manages to deleate the folder)
Removes the UAC
Restarts the PC
PC BSOD and bootloop.

To watch the effect of this virus you can watch my Youtube video covering the execution and consequences of the virus:

Why does the simple act of creating a folder called OSDATA in the config folder cause the system to crash?
I suggest you watch this video (where i got the idea to make this virus) explaining this:

WARNING: THE FIX IN THE VIDEO DOESN'T WORK WHEN YOU RUN THIS VIRUS.
